# Power Consumption | Current Sense System V2

Arduino based power consumption calculator. Print results as UART interface and OLED display, also have SD card to log data.

Maximum 8 differential channels, come out with 4x ADS1115 in one I2C bus. RGB OLED display (ST7789 130x160) results show as a real-time update also supports the SD card data log. 

** **Important** **

Before you log the power consumption results, the resistor value needs to be calculated by the multimeter. You can press the button to do the value change very quickly! 

After the data logging into the SD card, plot data into an image via a python script.
